# Four in a row

During my first year at the Haute École en Hainaut, I had a little project in C: the _Four in a row_ game in the **Terminal**.

The project has 'Rules display': it's available from the menu and it explains what the game is and how to play.

It's a multiplayer game: the yellow one begins and the red one follows.  

The letters are colored and the end messages contains emojis.  

The menu has three choices:  
1. Play the game;  
2. Display rules;  
3. Quit the game.
